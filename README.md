## Why?

Retro is a project that seeks to aggressively rethink Vim in order to:

- A lot of popular plugins ported to Retro
- Minimalist and Simplest visual ever
- Chromium-based GUI
- Enable advanced external UIs without modifications to the core
- Full Extensible'n Hackable Editor (allow to change interfaces brutally)
	- Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture
